# Precision Oncology through Interpretable Machine Learning : Tumor vs Normal Cell Signatures from Single-Cell Data

This project analyzes single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data from human breast cancers, focusing on distinguishing tumor and normal cell populations through comprehensive computational methods. The workflow includes data acquisition, feature engineering, copy number variation analysis, machine learning classification, and integration of therapeutic target information using DGIdb and Open Targets databases to identify clinically relevant gene targets for precision oncology.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Ensure Python 3.11.9 or above is installed.
- Ensure git is installed.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/mads-capstone-team24-summer-2025/ghost-cell-busters.git"
cd ghost-cell-busters
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Recommended: Use a virtual environment.

```sh
python -m venv venv  # On Windows
python3 -m venv venv  # On Mac/Linux

# Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, install these packages:

```sh
pip install scanpy pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn gseapy mygene infercnvpy shap xgboost imbalanced-learn gtfparse
```

### 4. Data Preparation

- Use the scripts in the `scripts/` folder to help organize and prepare your data:
  - For each dataset, run the corresponding script to download or process files as needed. For example:
    ```sh
    python scripts/GSE176078_asset.py
    ```
    This will help set up the `assets/GSE176078/` directory with required files.
  - Similarly, use `GSE161529_asset.py` and `GSE180286_asset.py` for other datasets.
  - To prepare gene annotation assets, run:
    ```sh
    python scripts/Gencode_asset.py
    ```
    This will download the GTF annotation file (`gencode.v44.annotation.gtf.gz`) if not already present.

### 5. Running the Analysis

- Open `notebooks/01_GSE176078.ipynb` and `notebooks/02_GSE176078_model.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
- Execute cells sequentially to:
  - Load and preprocess single-cell transcriptomics data
  - Engineer relevant features including cell cycle, apoptosis, ribosomal content, OXPHOS, and CNV scores
  - Classify tumor versus normal cells based on transcriptomic signatures
  - Visualize and explore classification results
  - Train machine learning models and interpret feature importance using SHAP values
- Repeat for other notebooks as needed.

## Main Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading:** Construct AnnData objects from raw single-cell sequencing data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Calculate key cellular features including cell cycle, apoptosis, ribosomal content, OXPHOS, and CNV scores.
3. **Cell Classification:** Identify and classify tumor versus normal cells based on transcriptomic and genomic signatures.
4. **Visualization:** Generate plots to explore distributions and proportions across cell subtypes and states.
5. **Differential Expression:** Detect genes differentially expressed between tumor and normal cells.
6. **CNV Analysis:** Annotate genes, perform inferCNV analysis, and quantify CNV burden per cell.
7. **Machine Learning:** Develop classifiers for tumor/normal prediction and interpret model outputs using SHAP.
8. **Therapeutic Mapping:** Integrate DGIdb druggability data and Open Targets disease association scores to stratify genes by therapeutic relevance and breast cancer support.

## Outputs

- Processed AnnData objects (`*obs.csv`)
- Machine Learning Model (`*.pkl`)
- Plots and figures (generated by running the notebooks)

---

## Notes

- The project uses both Python scripts and IPython notebooks.
- Some steps require substantial memory and compute (especially CNV and Machine Learning).
